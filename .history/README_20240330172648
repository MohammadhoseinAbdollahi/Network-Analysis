Exercise num 1. Warm up
With this first exercise we make some experience with a graph library. I will use NetworkX but you can use any other library of your choice

Install NetworkX (see documentation at: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)
Select a graph (see for example https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/auto_examples/index.html#graph)
Compute and print basic graph properties (e.g., number of nodes, number of links, diameter, adjacency list)
Draw the graph
Plot the degree distribution
Repeat steps 1-5, reading a graph from an external file (see for example the dataset available at https://networkrepository.com/)
