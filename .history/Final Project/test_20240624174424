# # Step 1: Define Data Structures
# category_followers = {}

# # Step 2: Parse JSON File
# with open('Final Project/SOC-GEMSEC-HR.JSON', 'r') as json_file:
#     node_categories = json.load(json_file)

# # Step 3: Process Data
# for node, categories in node_categories.items():
#     for category in categories:
#         if category not in category_followers:
#             category_followers[category] = []
#         category_followers[category].append(node)

# # Step 4: Parse Edges File and Update Data
# with open('Final Project/SOC-GEMSEC-HR.EDGES', 'r') as edges_file:
#     for line in edges_file:
#         source, target = line.strip().split(',')
#         if source in node_categories:

#                 if target not in category_followers[category]:
#                     category_followers[category].append(target)

# # Step 5: Create Graph
# # Assuming a simple graph structure where each node is connected to its categories
# graph = {}
# for category, followers in category_followers.items():
#     graph[category] = followers

# # Step 6: Output (For demonstration, printing the graph structure)
# print(json.dumps(graph, indent=4))
# # Step 7: Save Graph as JSON
# graph_json = json.dumps(graph)
# with open('graph.json', 'w') as json_file:
#     json_file.write(graph_json)
